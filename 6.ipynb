    "The curse of dimensionality is closely related to both overfitting and underfitting in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model learns to capture noise or random fluctuations in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. In high-dimensional spaces, the curse of dimensionality exacerbates the risk of overfitting because the number of possible models that fit the training data increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. With more dimensions, it becomes easier for a model to find spurious correlations in the data, leading to overfitting. This is because in high-dimensional spaces, the training data becomes more sparse, and there is a greater chance of finding patterns that are specific to the training set but do not generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data. In the context of the curse of dimensionality, underfitting can also occur if the model is unable to capture the complex relationships present in high-dimensional data. With a limited number of dimensions, the model may not have enough flexibility to represent the data adequately, leading to underfitting. This is particularly true when the true relationship between the features and the target variable is complex and nonlinear."
